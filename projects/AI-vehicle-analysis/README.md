**[Live demo →](https://zotriq-demos.streamlit.app/vehicle-analysis)**

An API that turns raw vehicle work-order history into a clear maintenance report. Ask in plain English,
for example *"Can you share a deep analysis for car id 34?"*, and it returns a summary of past repairs,
recurring issues and recommended next steps.

## How it works

```
User question
   └─► LLM (JSON mode) extracts vehicle_id / vehicle_name
         └─► Fetch the latest work orders from the fleet data API
               └─► Normalize header + line-item records into clean JSON
                     └─► LLM acting as a service advisor writes the analysis
                           └─► JSON response
```

1. **Query understanding:** an LLM on Groq (`GROQ_MODEL`, default `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) in JSON mode pulls the vehicle ID and name out of free text.
2. **Data retrieval:** the vehicle's most recent work orders are fetched from the fleet API (bearer-token auth). Without an API configured, the bundled sample fleet in `sample_data/workorders.json` (vehicles 34, 55 and 72, same raw format) is used.
3. **Normalization:** alternating work-order headers and line items are parsed into structured records.
4. **Analysis:** a second prompt reviews the history, spots repair trends and recurring faults, and gives recommendations.

## API

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/analyze-vehicle` | Takes a natural-language query and returns the vehicle and its maintenance analysis |

Interactive docs are available at `/docs` once the server is running.

## Getting started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b      # optional
url=https://your-fleet-api/workorders   # optional: leave out to use the sample fleet
DATA_API_KEY=your_data_api_key
```

Run the API:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

`app.ipynb` contains the same pipeline step by step, for experimenting.

Tests (no API keys needed): `pip install pytest && pytest`
